# Differences from londonmapbot

1. I added code to constrain points within a geographic area using a given shape file.
2. Using RSelenium, I query Wikipedia using the random coordinates to find points of interest. The first is added to the body of the tweet.
3. emo::ji() :)
4. I am working on an image classification model to categorize satellite images as either have "evidence" or "no evidence" of human settlement.
